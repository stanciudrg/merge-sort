# merge-sort
An array sorting utility module that uses the Merge Sort algorithm.

Time complexity:

Best (Omega) - Ω(n log(n)) (loglinear complexity)
Average (Theta) - Θ(n log(n)) (loglinear complexity)
Worst (Big O) - O(n log(n)) (loglinear complexity)

Space complexity: 

Worst (Big O) - O(n) (linear complexity)
